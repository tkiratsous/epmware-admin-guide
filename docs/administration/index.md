# Administration

The Administration module provides system management capabilities including service monitoring and application migration between environments. These tools enable administrators to maintain system health and move configurations across instances.

## Overview

The Administration module consists of two main components:

- **[Services](#services)** - Monitor and control EPMware background services
- **[Application Migration](#application-migration)** - Export/import applications and artifacts between environments

These tools are essential for:
- System maintenance and monitoring
- Environment management (DEV/UAT/PROD)
- Configuration backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery planning

## Best Practices

### 1. Service Management

- **Regular Monitoring** - Check service status daily
- **Scheduled Maintenance** - Plan service restarts
- **Log Review** - Monitor service logs for errors
- **Performance Tuning** - Adjust sleep intervals
- **Redundancy** - Configure service failover

### 2. Migration Strategy

- **Environment Alignment** - Keep environments synchronized
- **Incremental Updates** - Use merge for changes
- **Full Refresh** - Periodic replace imports
- **Testing Protocol** - Validate in lower environments
- **Rollback Plan** - Maintain backups before import

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Service Access** - Restrict to administrators
- **Migration Files** - Encrypt sensitive exports
- **Audit Trail** - Log all operations
- **Data Privacy** - Mask sensitive data in exports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Service won't start | Port conflict or permissions | Check logs, verify ports |
| Migration export fails | Large data volume | Increase timeout, export in parts |
| Import validation errors | Missing dependencies | Import dependencies first |
| Memory errors | Large dataset | Increase heap size |
| Service stops unexpectedly | Memory or connection issues | Review logs, restart |

### Service Troubleshooting

Check service issues:
```sql
-- Check service status
SELECT service_name, status, last_run_date, error_message
FROM ew_services
ORDER BY last_run_date DESC;

-- View service locks
SELECT * FROM ew_service_locks
WHERE lock_date < SYSDATE - 1/24;  -- Locks older than 1 hour
```

### Migration Troubleshooting

Common migration fixes:
1. **Dependency Order** - Import in correct sequence
2. **Security Classes** - Import before assignments
3. **Lookups** - Import before references
4. **Scripts** - Import before validations

## Integration Points

### Global Settings

Service configuration:
- Service intervals
- Timeout settings
- File size limits
- Debug levels

### Workflow Integration

Services interact with workflows:
- Workflow service processes tasks
- Deployment service executes deployments
- Email service sends notifications

### Email Notifications

Migration notifications:
- Export completion
- Import success/failure
- Validation errors

### Logic Builder

Scripts for processing:
- Pre-export validation
- Post-import processing
- Custom migration logic
