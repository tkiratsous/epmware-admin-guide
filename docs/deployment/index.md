# Deployment

The Deployment module manages the automated deployment of approved metadata changes to target applications. It provides centralized control over when and how metadata is deployed, with comprehensive monitoring, scheduling, and multi-environment support.

![Deployment Overview](../assets/images/deployment/deployment-overview.png)<br/>
*Deployment module showing Manager, Monitor, and Schedule tabs*

## Overview

The Deployment module consists of three integrated components:

- **[Deployment Manager](#deployment-manager)** - Create and configure deployment definitions
- **[Deployment Monitor](#deployment-monitor)** - Track deployment execution and status
- **[Deployment Schedule](#deployment-schedule)** - View and manage scheduled deployments

Key capabilities include:
- Direct deployment to target applications
- File-based deployment for manual processing
- Interface table deployment for integrations
- Multi-environment cascade deployments
- Pre and post-deployment scripting
- Comprehensive email notifications

## Deployment Manager

Deployment Manager creates and manages deployment configurations that determine what, when, and how metadata is deployed.

![Deployment Manager Grid](../assets/images/deployment/deployment-manager-grid.png)<br/>
*Deployment Manager showing configured deployments*

### Deployment Components

| Component | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Deployment identifier | User-defined |
| **Description** | Deployment purpose | Optional text |
| **Type** | Deployment scope | Application, Workflow, Request |
| **Pre-Deployment Scripts** | Scripts run before deployment | Logic Builder scripts |
| **Post-Deployment Scripts** | Scripts run after deployment | Logic Builder scripts |

#### Workflow Deployment  
Deploys approved requests from specific workflows:
- Workflow-specific processing
- Useful for different SLAs
- Segregates by business process
- Can have different schedules

#### Request Deployment
Deploys individual or grouped requests:
- Selective deployment
- Emergency changes
- Failed request redeployment
- Manual control

!!! note "Redeployment Behavior"
    Redeployed requests are added to the deployment pool and processed during the next scheduled execution.

### Handling Partial Deployments

When deployment status shows **Partial**:

1. **Identify Failed Items**:
   - Click Deployment ID
   - Review failed request lines
   - Note error messages

2. **Resolution Options**:
   - Fix data issues and redeploy
   - Cancel failed lines
   - Manually close deployment

3. **Prevention**:
   - Add validation stages
   - Improve pre-deployment scripts
   - Test in lower environments

## Multi-Environment Deployment

Deploy metadata through multiple environments in sequence.

### Configuration Overview

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Approved Request] --> B[Deploy to DEV]
    B --> C[Deploy to UAT]
    C --> D[Deploy to PROD]
```

### Setup Components

1. **Shell Applications** - Logical non-production apps
2. **Environments** - Define tiers (DEV, UAT, PROD)
3. **Deployment Order** - Sequence of deployments
4. **Environment Mapping** - Link apps to environments

### Example Configuration

#### Define Environments

| Environment | Deployment Order | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Development | 1 | First deployment |
| UAT | 2 | After DEV success |
| Production | 3 | Final deployment |

#### Create Environment-Specific Deployments

```
Deployment 1:
Name: DEP_Development
Environment: Development
Schedule: Auto

Deployment 2:
Name: DEP_UAT
Environment: UAT
Schedule: Daily 6:00 PM

Deployment 3:
Name: DEP_Production
Environment: Production
Schedule: Daily 11:00 PM
```

---

## Deployment Scripts

Enhance deployments with Logic Builder scripts.

### Pre-Deployment Scripts

Execute before metadata deployment:

```javascript
// Backup current metadata
function preDeploymentBackup(context) {
    var timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    var backupName = context.applicationName + "_" + timestamp;
    
    // Create backup
    backupMetadata(context.applicationId, backupName);
    
    // Validate target system availability
    if (!isSystemAvailable(context.targetServer)) {
        throw new Error("Target system unavailable");
    }
    
    return {
        status: "SUCCESS",
        backupName: backupName
    };
}
```

### Post-Deployment Scripts

Execute after successful deployment:

```javascript
// Refresh dependent systems
function postDeploymentRefresh(context) {
    // Refresh Essbase outline
    refreshEssbaseOutline(context.applicationName);
    
    // Clear and reload Smart View
    clearSmartViewCache();
    
    // Send notification to users
    notifyUsers(context.deploymentId, "Deployment completed");
    
    // Update audit log
    logDeployment(context);
    
    return { status: "SUCCESS" };
}
```

## Deployment Schedule Tab

View all scheduled deployments in one place.

![Deployment Schedule Grid](../assets/images/deployment/deployment-schedule-grid.png)<br/>
*Deployment Schedule showing upcoming executions*

### Schedule Grid Information

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Deployment name |
| **Description** | Deployment purpose |
| **Next Deployment Date** | Next execution time |
| **Frequency** | Schedule type |
| **Type** | Deployment type |

### Managing Schedules

- **Modify**: Change via Manager tab
- **Disable**: Uncheck enabled in Manager
- **View History**: Check Monitor tab
- **Upcoming**: Sort by next deployment date

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Deployment Strategy

- **Batch Similar Changes** - Group related updates
- **Off-Peak Scheduling** - Deploy during maintenance windows
- **Environment Progression** - DEV ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí PROD
- **Backup First** - Always backup before deployment
- **Test Scripts** - Validate pre/post scripts

### 2. Schedule Optimization

- **Production** - Daily at 11 PM or later
- **UAT** - Multiple times daily
- **Development** - Auto or frequent
- **Emergency** - One-time deployments
- **Batch Size** - Limit requests per deployment

### 3. Monitoring

- **Enable Auto-Refresh** - During deployments
- **Check Logs** - Review for warnings
- **Track Patterns** - Identify recurring issues
- **Set Alerts** - Email on failures
- **Archive Logs** - Maintain history

### 4. Error Handling

- **Immediate Notification** - Email on error
- **Log Attachment** - Include in notifications
- **Redeploy Strategy** - Define retry approach
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Track failure patterns
- **Rollback Plans** - Document procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Deployment not running | Not scheduled or disabled | Check schedule and enabled status |
| Stuck in Running | Timeout or system issue | Check logs, restart service |
| Partial deployment | Some requests failed | Review errors, redeploy failed |
| No requests found | Wrong type or filter | Verify deployment type configuration |
| Email not sent | Template not configured | Check email template assignment |
| Script error | Logic Builder issue | Debug script independently |
| Wrong environment | Mapping incorrect | Verify environment configuration |

### Deployment Logs

Access detailed logs:

1. Click log icon in Monitor grid
2. Review for:
   - Error messages

### Performance Tuning

Optimize deployment performance:

```
Global Settings ‚Üí Application Settings:
- Maximum # of Minutes for Deployment: 180
- Deployment Service Sleep Interval: 5
- File Size Limits: Adjust as needed
```
